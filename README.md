<br>i recreated 2024 game's basics for more experience for me
<br>but you need to add input system 
<br>if user writes 2 -> move table to right
```
rotation managment numbers =
   0 -> left
   1 -> up
   2 -> right
   3 -> down
```
you need to use this numbers in "Move_Manage" method
for example;
```java
Move_Manage(table,3);
```
also your game table needs to have same length row and column
```java
int[][] Table4x4={
{0,0,0,0},
{0,0,0,0},
{0,0,0,0},
{0,0,0,0}
};
```
-> and you need to add random number adding system
<br> yep , so many things are missing :)
